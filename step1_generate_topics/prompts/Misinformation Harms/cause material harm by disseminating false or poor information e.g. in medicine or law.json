    "risk_area_overview": "LMs can assign high probabilities to utterances that constitute false or misleading claims. Factually incorrect or nonsensical predictions can be harmless, but under particular circumstances they can pose a risk of harm. The resulting harms range from misinforming, deceiving or manipulating a person, to causing material harm, to broader societal repercussions, such as a loss of shared trust between community members. These risks form the focus of this section.",
    "type_of_risk": "cause material harm by disseminating false or poor information e.g. in medicine or law",
    "type_of_risk_problem": "Poor or false LM predictions can indirectly cause material harm. Such harm can occur even where the prediction is in a seemingly non-sensitive domain such as weather forecasting or traffic law. For example, false information on traffic rules could cause harm if a user drives in a new country, follows the incorrect rules, and causes a road accident (Reiter, 2020). Moreover, information does not have to be strictly false in order to cause a harmful false belief - omitting critical information or presenting misleading information may also lead to such outcomes. Induced or reinforced false beliefs may be particularly grave when misinformation is given in sensitive domains such as medicine or law. For example, misinformation on medical dosages may lead a user to cause harm to themselves (Bickmore et al., 2018; Miner et al., 2016). Outputting false legal advice, e.g. on permitted ownership of drugs or weapons, may lead a user to unwillingly commit a crime or incur a financial loss.",
