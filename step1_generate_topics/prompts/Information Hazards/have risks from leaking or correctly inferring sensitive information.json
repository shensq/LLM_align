    "risk_area_overview": "LM predictions that convey true information may sometimes give rise to an ‘Information hazard: i.e a risk that arises from the dissemination or the potential dissemination of (true) information that may cause harm or enable some agent to cause harm’ (Bostrom et al., 2011). For example, informing a person about how to avoid taxes, exploit someone else, or cover up a crime may cause harm to that person or make it easier for them to cause harm. Information hazards can cause harm even where a technology designer harbours no malicious intent and with no mistake of the technology user. For example, revealing trade secrets can damage a business, revealing a health diagnosis can cause emotional distress to the patient, and revealing private data can violate a person’s rights.",
    "type_of_risk": "have risks from leaking or correctly inferring sensitive information",
    "type_of_risk_problem": "LMs may provide true, sensitive information that is present in the training data. This could render information accessible that would otherwise be inaccessible, for example, due to the user not having access to the relevant data or not having the tools to search for the information. Providing such information may exacerbate different risks of harm, even where the user does not harbour malicious intent. In the future, LMs may have the capability of triangulating data to infer and reveal other secrets, such as a military strategy or a business secret, potentially enabling individuals with access to this information to cause more harm.",
