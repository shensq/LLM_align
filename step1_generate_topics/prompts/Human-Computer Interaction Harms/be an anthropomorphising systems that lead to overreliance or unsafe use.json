    "risk_area_overview": "This section focuses on risks from language technologies that engage a user via dialogue and are built on language models (LMs). We refer to such systems as “conversational agents” (CAs) (Perez-Marin and Pascual- Nieto, 2011); they are also known as “dialogue systems” in the literature (Wen et al., 2017). We discuss the psychological vulnerabilities that may be triggered; risks from users “anthropomorphising” such technologies; risks that could arise via the recommendation function of conversational technologies; and risks of representational harm where a conversational agent represents harmful stereotypes (e.g. when a “secretary agent” is by default represented as female). Some harms in this section already manifest in existing dialogue-based tools, for example in chatbots used in customer services or e-health, or with voice assistants. Where possible, relevant examples are listed below. At present most of these technologies do not rely on LMs. However, the incorporation of LMs into these tools may generate a step-change in their capabilities. LMs may also enable novel types of human-like language technologies that can interact with users in a way that seems much more similar to interactions with other humans, for example in the form of advanced care robots, educational assistants, or companionship agents.",
    "type_of_risk": "be an anthropomorphising systems that lead to overreliance or unsafe use",
    "type_of_risk_problem": "Natural language is a mode of communication that is particularly used by humans. As a result, humans interacting with conversational agents may come to think of these agents as human-like. Anthropomorphising LMs may inflate users’ estimates of the conversational agent’s competencies. For example, users may falsely infer that a conversational agent that appears human-like in language also displays other human-like characteristics, such as holding a coherent identity over time, or being capable of empathy, perspective-taking, and rational reasoning. As a result, they may place undue confidence, trust, or expectations in these agents. Note that these effects do not require the user to actually believe that the chatbot is human: rather, a ‘mindless’ anthropomorphism effect takes place, whereby users respond to more human-like chatbots with more social responses even though they know that the chatbots are not human (Kim and Sundar, 2012). This can result in different risks of harm, for example when human users rely on conversational agents in domains where this may cause knock-on harms, such as requesting psychotherapy. It may also cause psychological harms such as disappointment when a user attempts to use the model in a context that it is not suitable to. Anthropomorphisation may amplify risks of users yielding effective control by coming to trust conversational agents “blindly”. Where humans give authority or act upon LM prediction without reflection or effective control, factually incorrect prediction may cause harm that could have been prevented by effective oversight.",
