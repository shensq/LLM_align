    "risk_area_overview": "Language has long been a vehicle for perpetuating injustices against marginalised populations and conferring power to oppressive institutions (Craft et al., 2020; Lippi, 1997). Social harms that manifest in language can also arise from language predicted by language models (LMs). We distinguish between the following harms. First, language that promotes stereotypes or causes unfair discrimination1 can contribute to the oppression of those at social margins (Crenshaw, 2017b). Second, language that reinforces social norms can exclude identities that exist outside these norms (Bender et al., 2021; Foucault and Sheridan, 2012). Third, language can be ‘toxic’, for example by inciting violence or causing offense (Fortuna and Nunes, 2018). Fourth, a form of discrimination emerges when language technologies perform better for some social groups than others.",

    "type_of_risk_problem": "LM’s may predict hate speech or other language that is “toxic”. While there is no single agreed definition of what constitutes hate speech or toxic speech (Fortuna and Nunes, 2018; Persily and Tucker, 2020; Schmidt and Wiegand, 2017), proposed definitions often include profanities, identity attacks, sleights, insults, threats, sexually explicit content, demeaning language, language that incites violence, or ‘hostile and malicious language targeted at a person or group because of their actual or perceived innate characteristics’ (Fortuna and Nunes, 2018; Gorwa et al., 2020; PerspectiveAPI), direct quote from (Persily and Tucker, 2020). Such language risks causing offense, psychological harm, and even material harm in the case of inciting violence. Toxic speech is a widespread problem on online platforms (Duggan, 2017; Gorwa et al., 2020) and in training corpora such as (Gehman et al., 2020; Luccioni and Viviano, 2021; Radford et al., 2018b). Moreover, the problem of toxic speech online platforms from LMs is not easy to address. Toxicity mitigation techniques have been shown to perpetuate discriminatory biases whereby toxicity detection tools more often falsely flag utterances from historically marginalised groups as toxic (Dixon et al., 2018; Jigsaw, 2021; Kim et al., 2020), and detoxification methods work less well for these same groups (Sap et al., 2019; Welbl et al., 2021).",
