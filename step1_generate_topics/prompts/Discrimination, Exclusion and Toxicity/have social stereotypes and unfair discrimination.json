    "risk_area_overview": "Language has long been a vehicle for perpetuating injustices against marginalised populations and conferring power to oppressive institutions (Craft et al., 2020; Lippi, 1997). Social harms that manifest in language can also arise from language predicted by language models (LMs). We distinguish between the following harms. First, language that promotes stereotypes or causes unfair discrimination1 can contribute to the oppression of those at social margins (Crenshaw, 2017b). Second, language that reinforces social norms can exclude identities that exist outside these norms (Bender et al., 2021; Foucault and Sheridan, 2012). Third, language can be ‘toxic’, for example by inciting violence or causing offense (Fortuna and Nunes, 2018). Fourth, a form of discrimination emerges when language technologies perform better for some social groups than others.",

    "type_of_risk_problem": "Perpetuating harmful stereotypes and discrimination is a well-documented harm in machine learning models that represent natural language (Caliskan et al., 2017). LMs that encode discriminatory language or social stereotypes can cause different types of harm. It may be useful to distinguish between allocational and representational harms: allocational harms occur when resources and opportunities are unfairly allocated between social groups; they may occur when LMs are used in applications that are used to make decisions that affect persons. Representational harms include stereotyping, misrepresenting, and demeaning social groups Barocas and Wallach cited in (Blodgett et al., 2020). Unfair discrimination manifests in differential treatment or access to resources among individuals or groups based on sensitive traits such as sex, religion, gender, sexual orientation, ability and age. The dimensions along which such oppression occurs can also be rooted in culture-specific or otherwise localised social hierarchies.  For example, the Hindu caste system underpins discrimination in India, but not across the globe (Sambasivan et al., 2021). Additionally, injustice can be compounded when social categories intersect, for example in the discrimination against a person that holds a marginalised gender and a marginalised religion (Crenshaw, 2017a). Allocational harm caused by discriminatory systems is particularly salient if bias occurs in applications that materially impact people’s lives, such as predicting a person’s creditworthiness (Mehrabi et al., 2019), criminal recidivism (Angwin et al., 2016), or suitability to a job (Mujtaba and Mahapatra, 2019). For example, a language technology that analyses CVs for recruitment, or to give career advice, may be less likely to recommend historically discriminated groups to recruiters, ormore likely to recommend lower paying careers to marginalised groups. Unfair biases are already well-documented in machine learning applications ranging from diagnostic healthcare algorithms (Obermeyer et al., 2019) to social outcome prediction (Narayanan, 2021); for a more general introduction see (Chouldechova and Roth, 2018; Kordzadeh and Ghasemaghaei, 2021; Mehrabi et al., 2021; Noble, 2018; Zou and Schiebinger, 2018). Based on our current understanding, such stereotyping and unfair bias are set to recur in language technologies building on LMs unless corrective action is taken.",
