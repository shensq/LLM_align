    "risk_area_overview": "LMs can potentially amplify a person’s capacity to intentionally cause harm by automating the generation of targeted text or code. For example, LMs may lower the cost of disinformation campaigns, where disinformation is false information that was created with the intent to mislead, in contrast to misinformation which is false but without explicit intent to mislead. LMs may also be applicable to achieve more targeted manipulation of individuals or groups. Additional use-cases than those mentioned here may also be possible: as a multidisciplinary research workshop on LMs argued, it is difficult to scope all possible (mis-)uses of such models (Tamkin et al., 2021). Notably, to cause such harms, LMs alone may be insufficient: the design of targeted language agents (see Definitions) or language technologies may also be required.",

    "type_of_risk_problem": "The collection of large amounts of information about people for the purpose of mass surveillance has raised ethical and social concerns, including risk of censorship and of undermining public discourse (Cyphers and Gebhart, 2019; Stahl, 2016; Véliz, 2019). Sifting through these large datasets previously required millions of human analysts (Hunt and Xu, 2013), but is increasingly being automated using AI (Andersen, 2020; Shahbaz and Funk, 2019). Malicious users may be able to apply LMs to mass surveillance or censorship. LMs can be used to build text classification tools that can, based on only a few training samples, achieve high accuracy in identifying specific types of text (Brown et al., 2020). Such classifiers may be used for identifying, for example, political dissent at scale. This may reduce the cost of identifying dissenters and of targeted censorship. Increased surveillance or censorship may amplify existing feedback loops such as “chilling effects”, whereby the anticipation of surveillance leads individuals to self-censor (Kwon et al., 2015). In a distinct feedback loop, censorship of web text, for example of online encyclopedias, can then affect the quality of a LM trained on such data (Yang and Roberts, 2021).",
