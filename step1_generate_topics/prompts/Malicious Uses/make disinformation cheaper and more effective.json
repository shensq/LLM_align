    "risk_area_overview": "LMs can potentially amplify a person’s capacity to intentionally cause harm by automating the generation of targeted text or code. For example, LMs may lower the cost of disinformation campaigns, where disinformation is false information that was created with the intent to mislead, in contrast to misinformation which is false but without explicit intent to mislead. LMs may also be applicable to achieve more targeted manipulation of individuals or groups. Additional use-cases than those mentioned here may also be possible: as a multidisciplinary research workshop on LMs argued, it is difficult to scope all possible (mis-)uses of such models (Tamkin et al., 2021). Notably, to cause such harms, LMs alone may be insufficient: the design of targeted language agents (see Definitions) or language technologies may also be required.",

    "type_of_risk_problem": "LMs can be used to create synthetic media and ‘fake news’, and may reduce the cost of producing disinformation at scale (Buchanan et al., 2021). While some predict that it will be cheaper to hire humans to generate disinformation (Tamkin et al., 2021), it is possible that LM-assisted content generation may offer a cheaper way of generating diffuse disinformation at scale. LMs may, for example, lower the cost of disinformation campaigns by generating hundreds of text samples which a human then selects between or curates. Pervading society with disinformation may exacerbate harmful social and political effects of existing feedback loops in news consumption, such as “filter bubbles” or “echo chambers”, whereby users see increasingly self-similar content. This can lead to a loss of shared knowledge and increased polarisation (Colleoni et al., 2014; Dutton and Robertson, 2021), especially where LMs underpin language technologies that resemble recommender systems11. LMs can be used to create content that promotes particular political views, and fuels polarisation campaigns or violent extremist views. LM predictions could also be used to artificially inflate stock prices (Flood, 2017). Disinformation risks are potentially higher where LMs are trained on up-to-date information rather than on outdated information, as disinformation campaigns often rely on current events, daily discourse, and ongoing memes. Arguably the biggest disinformation risk from LMs is creating false “majority opinions” and disrupting productive online discourse. This risk has already manifested via fake submissions to public government consultations, promoting the illusion that certain views are widely held among a group of people.",
